In the resonant column  apparatuses  a cylindrical  soil /rock specimen is subjected to longitudinal or torsion  steady-state harmonic vibrations superimposed  upon  an isotropic static stress. The resonant column specimen is identical in shape, dimensions and sampling to those used in classical triaxial testing. The sample  and vibration device are enclosed into a cell chamber where the confining  conditions are supplied by compressed air, water or mineral oil. The pressure amount is so selected that spherical stresses or sample are equivalent ,to the  depth of the sample, to the stress conditions in the field. It is well established that soil/rock response is nonlinear beyond a certain level of deformation. Laboratory tests performed on Hardin and Drnevich resonant columns consistently show the reduction in dynamic torsion modulus functions(G) and increase in torsion damping functions ( Î¾) with increasing shear strain (Î³) above 10-4 %,i.e. these parameters are function of shear strain, G=G(Î³) and Î¾=Î¾(Î³).
