A total of 11 infrasound stations are currently installed at Mt. Etna.\u000aThe accelerometers installed at Etna are 4, all equipped with tri-axial sensor Kinemetrics EpiSensor Model FBA ES-T, with sensitivity increased to 40V / g (0.5 g), including a bandwidth between DC and 200 Hz and sampling rate at 200 sps.\u000aThe number of permanent seismic stations present in the volcanic archipelago of the Aeolian Islands (16 stations) allows a careful monitoring of both the earthquakes throughout the area and the seismo-volcanic signals of Vulcano and Stromboli. In fact, on these two islands there is a higher density of stations: 9 on the island of Vulcano and 3 on Stromboli (further 14 broadband stations are operated by the Osservatorio Vesuviano of INGV). \u000aIn more detail, 11 velocimetric stations operate in the various islands: 7 digital 24-bit stations equipped with 3-component broadband (40s) sensors and 4 analog stations equipped with short period (1s) sensors. In addition there are 5 digital (16-bit) stations of the old mobile network, equipped with 3-component broad-band sensors (Lennartz 20s), operating since 2005 at the Fossa of Vulcano in a configuration of permanent seismic array.\u000aSome of these sites (Alicudi, Lipari, Vulcano) are also equipped with accelerometers to record signals from strong-motion seismogenic areas of the Gulf of Patti and of the lower Tyrrhenian basin. \u000aFinally, the Seismic Mobile Network is the temporary measurement apparatus mainly used during emergencies to integrate the seismic-volcanic coverage of the seismic permanent network, and to conduct scientific experiments and campaigns of acquisition also outside of the institutional areas monitored by the Catania section. Currently, the mobile network is equipped with 10 digital stations \"Nanometrics Taurusâ€, equipped with 3-component broadband (Lennartz LE-3D/20s, Compact 120 sec Trillium, Trillium 120 PA) sensors capable of operating in stand alone.

Since 1995, we have realized 36 stations on Mt. Etna, 5 stations on Stromboli volcano, 7 on Vulcano-Lipari complex and 3 on Pantelleria Island. \u000aAll these stations are linked to the master station of Catania through radio link. Almost all of these stations transmit data at 1Hz sampling rate and these data are also processed in real time and low latency (1 sec). The objectives of these network are two: i) to know day-by-day - or, for some volcanoes, second-by-second - the evolution of the ground deformation pattern for monitoring purposes and ii) to improve our knowledge of the internal processes of magma transfer form depth, focusing in particular those leading to potentially dangerous eruptions. \u000a\u000aTilt Network \u000aContinuous tilt measurements are used for ground deformation monitoring in many volcanic areas and are usually used to record middle-short term eruption precursors. Slow (weekly-monthly) tilt variations could indicate inflation caused by rising magma prior to the eruption or deflation linked to energy release following eruptions, while fast tilt variations (from hours to days) are related to rapid rise of magma and propagation of dikes and eruptive fissures. Then, continuous acquisition allowed identifying eruption precursors and provided an important contribution to the modeling of the volcano sources acting during eruptions. Amplitude of these tilt variations may vary over several orders of magnitude but generally consists of several microradians (ï­rad); other processes, such as faulting and long-term volcano/tectonic processes or â€“ sometimes - summit crater paroxystic events, are generally characterized by smaller variations that may be masked by noise. Tilt signals are affected by various surface and temperature-related noise effects that may be related to distortion effects of the topography, air pressure, water table variations and tides but mainly to the temperature fluctuations that cause thermo-elastic strain\u000aSince 2007, INGV-CT installed several deep stations using new high resolution instruments, self-leveling with on-board magnetic compass. A constant recorded temperature characterizes the depth sensors and recorded signals are characterized by a very low noise that has allowed detecting the tilt tides. Currently there are 13 bore-hole tilt stations and one long-base fluid tiltmeter installed on Mt. Etna; other 9 tilt stations operate on Aeolian Islands and 3 on Pantelleria Island.\u000a\u000aGeodetic surveys\u000aGround deformation studies on Sicilian volcanoes started in the seventies by the first trilateration network installed on Etna in 1974 and Lipari and Vulcano islands in 1975, followed in 1979 by the first trilateration network on Pantelleria island. \u000aThese networks were surveyed at least yearly by Electronic Distance Meters (EDM) technique, measuring distances between points. Also a levelling network was installed and surveyed yearly around Etna at medium altitude and on Vulcano island, managed by Osservatorio Vesuviano of Naples (now INGV-OV). EDM surveys on Etna were carried out until 2007. \u000aFrom 1988, a Global Positioning System (GPS) network has been installed, surveyed and continuously improved on Mt. Etna. The first network consisted in 9 benchmarks chosen in order to include stable points outside the volcano and to tie the different geodetic networks already existing. Currently, the GPS network on Etna consists of more than 80 benchmarks, from the sea level up to the summit craters and including some stable reference points around the volcano. \u000aAlso Lipari, Vulcano and Pantelleria networks have been progressively improved in time and measured by GPS technique. Currently, 27 benchmarks lie on the Lipari - Vulcano and 10 on Pantelleria islands. A local EDM array exists on the â€œLa Forgiaâ€ unstable sector of Vulcano. \u000aOn Stromboli, ground deformation carried out by EDM during the 2002-2003 eruption allowed the monitoring of the slope stability of the â€œSciara del Fuocoâ€ flank. The EDM surveys were replaced in 2003 by a robotized Total Station that continuously measured the 3D position of 22 benchmarks inside the unstable Sciara del Fuoco slope (THEODOROS Sytem). The Total Station monitors the motion of the lava fan produced after the 2007 eruption.\u000a\u000aGravity networks\u000aExperiments carried out on Mt. Etna over the last fifteen years have demonstrated the ability of the gravity method to constrain the magma movements involved in the main phases of the volcano activity. Temporal gravity changes in volcanic zones are related to sub-surface mass-redistributions or to elevation changes in response to a magmatic activity and vary according to the size, depth and rate of evolution (e.g. degassing) of the magma bodies involved. The associated gravity anomalies can thus change significantly in both space (wavelengths ranging from hundreds of meters to tens of kilometers) and time (periods ranging from minutes to years). The choice of monitoring strategy (i.e. spacing between network stations, rate at which campaigns are accomplished, number of stations in continuous, etc.) is therefore crucial for correctly assessing geophysical parameters. The relative gravity network of Mt Etna is currently made up of 71 benchmarks located 0.5 to 4 km apart and covering an area of about 400 km2 and consists of four integrated sub-arrays. To couple the existing network for discrete measurements and extend the range of periods of measurable anomalies down to a few minutes, three continuously running gravity stations (1 minute sampling) are also operative at Mt. Etna. In 2007 the gravity network was renewed and integrated with 13 new absolute stations arranged as a ring around the volcano at elevations of between 1500 and 2000 m a.s.l. We employ the combined use of absolute and relative gravimeters as hybrid method to extend the potential of gravity measurements for surveying the Etna volcanic area. The hybrid method allow to obtain gravity information having an accuracy comparable to absolute gravity information by using an array of relative gravimeters."},

In addition, the MEO forms the data and analysis center for the BayernNetz, a network of 22 digital seismic stations designed for monitoring the seismic activity in Bavaria and neighboring areas (http://www.erdbeben-in-bayern.de).\u000aThe MEO is contributing to the OREFEUS based VEBSN with additional\u000abroadband stations RotzenmÃ¼hle (ROTZ, Manzenberg (MANZ), Jochberg\u000a(RJOB) and Garching a.d. Alz (KW1). The MEO is actively involved in the\u000aseismic monitoring of deep geothermal power plants located in the Bavarian molasses. This is part of a Federal Ministry of Environment financed research project on induced seismicity. The focus of the scientific research at the MEO seismology branch consists on the investigation of swarm quake areas and mechanisms (Vogtland; Bad\u000aReichenhall) and research on volcano induced seismic signals as well as in improving monitoring capabilities of seismological/volcanic surveillance networks. This includes also the development of software solutions for seismological/volcanological observatories.\u000aGeomagnetics: It is the Munich Earth Observatory's RESPONSIBILITY to\u000acontinuously measure the Earth's magnetic field at its location in\u000aFuerstenfeldbruck, far away from the busy city of Munich and other industrial areas, where artificial magnetic fields would interfere the measurements. The geological subsurface at Fuerstenfeldbruck makes the location ideal to measure the magnetic main field that originates from the Earth's core.\u000aMeasurements were started in 1939 and are a continuation of the measurements in Maisach (1927 - 1932) and Munich (1840 - 1926). This\u000aallows the Munich Earth Observatory to continue one of the oldest and most precious time series in geomagnetism. Our observatory's MISSION is: (1) to reliably track the changes of the Earth's magnetic field with absolute accuracy and highest temporal resolution by means of the most advanced instruments and techniques available, (2) to conduct research on the observatory's and\u000aothers' geomagnetic field data and to attract external funding for these studies, (3) to make available its expertise in geomagnetic field\u000ameasurements to others in the form of international scientific co-operations,public outreach, and university education."},

In the course of its activities over the years, a\u000abetter understanding of the seismicity and the seismic risk of various areas of S.\u000aAegean were accomplished. At the same time a number of microzonation studies\u000awere performed contributing in seismic hazard mitigation and many local seismic\u000astation networks for monitoring and determining the seismotectonic regime of the\u000acertain areas- were deployed. Certain applications of theoretical aspects of seismology\u000ato Greek data resulted in revised and/or local seismic intensity and seismic energy\u000aattenuation laws and in the determination of seismic source parameters for a large\u000anumber of events. In recent years, major advances were made in the field of\u000aGeophysics, based on the application of dynamic, seismic, electromagnetic and\u000amagnetotelluric methods.

It is one of the longest running test sites in the world, aiming to allow detailed and well documented studies in many fields of Engineering Seismology, Earthquake Engineering, Soil Dynamics and Seismology, open to the scientific community. Emphasis is given to the experimental and theoretical analysis of complex site effects, wave propagation and the soil-foundation-structure interaction. EUROSEISTEST is also specially designed and constructed for the validation of various codes in earthquake engineering, wave propagation in complex media, weak and strong ground motion estimates; moreover it is adequate for the development of new technologies and innovative methods to assess the dynamic soil properties and geophysics (i.e. ambient noise measurements). It is a unique large-scale test site, allowing combined geophysical, geotechnical and structural experiments and high level studies. \u000a\u000aThe 2D N-cross section (initially in the N ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ S cross-section), in the middle of the valley was efficiently determined with an extensive program of geophysical and geotechnical surveys (Figures 1 & 2). Based on this well constrained 2D structure, different theoretical and experimental site response analyses have been made (Figure 3). These studies have shown the large impact that surface geology and local site conditions have on ground motion, due to surface waves diffraction at the edges and lateral discontinuities of the basin. The Mygdonian valley, however, is a complex 3D structure, and the selection of a 2D cross-section was a compromise between the need to study a complex valley and the available resources. The recent improvement and upgrade of EUROSEISTEST large-scale facility is now providing the detailed geometry and geotechnical properties of the actual 3D structure (approximately 10x20km, Figure 4). The extension from 2D into a fully 3D structure contributes significantly in understanding the physics of wave propagation in complex geology and in response, as well as to improve the accuracy of prediction for the design strong ground motion. Actually EUROSEISTEST valley is probably the best-known valley in the world, both from the geometrical and the geological-geotechnical point of view.\u000a\u000aThe seismicity of the area is monitored on continuous basis by the seismological network of the Aristotle University and the permanent strong motion EUROSEISTEST array. The array has continuously expanded since 1993, and is presently deployed in a 3D configuration, while it comprises 20 high-resolution surface and down-hole stations, covering the main part of the valley (Figures 5 & 6).\u000a\u000aBesides the permanent strong motion network a simplified model SDOF structure has been designed, constructed and instrumented in the centre of the valley (TST see Figure 5), in order to perform dynamic forced and free response analyses, and investigate the soil-foundation-structure interaction phenomenon (Figure 7). The model structure comprises of a reinforced concrete foundation plate, and four steel columns supporting the reinforced concrete roof, joined together with X-braces in both directions. The whole foundation-structure system has configurable mass (total foundation mass may vary from 20 to 30 tonnes) stiffness depending also on the mass. The fixed base resonant frequency of the model may range from 5 to 10Hz, in order to adjust its dynamic properties according to the need. The outer dimensions of the structure are 3x3x5.2m. A temporary array of high resolution accelerometers, velocimeters, seismometers and strain gages can been deployed on the structures, beneath the structure at different depths and on the surface of the ground around the structure in order to record the wave propagation field (with depth as well), the ground  and structural response due to forced or free vibration tests. Earthquakes (quite frequent in the region) could be also recorded.\u000a\u000aThe simplified structure and its temporary or semi-temporary monitoring system (see Figure 7), along with the permanent strong motion array in EUROSEISTEST, can be used in order to simulate in large physical scale the soil-foundation-structure interaction phenomenon. Using the existing equipment and facilities, forced and free vibration tests can be performed either by pull-out of the structure, or with an eccentric mass shaker. The model structure is also perfectly appropriate to perform system identification analyses, as well as investigation of the wave field and the soil behaviour in the vicinity of the oscillating structure due to the structural vibration. \u000a\u000aA large number of universities and institutes from all over the world have been involved in its activities of EUROSEISTEST and more than 200 scientific papers, based on EUROSEISTEST data and results, have been published in books, journals and peer review proceedings of international conferences.\u000a"},

Since then, one of its main objectives is monitoring of seismicity in Western Greece, the area with the highest seismicity in Europe. UPSL is now member of the recently established Hellenic Unified Seismic Network (HUSN), an association operating more than 100 seismic stations. Within HUSN, UPSL has the responsibility of earthquake monitoring in central-western Greece. This task is accomplished through the operation of PSLNET (Patras Satellite Link NETwork). This is a network based on broad band sensors and digital satellite transmission comprising 27 stations. Real time data are transmitted to central station in Patras University and then stored and processed both automatically and manually. Phase picks, locations and moment tensor solutions are stored in our web page (http://seismo.geology.upatras.gr/) and also sent to EMSC.  UPSL possesses a portable network of 120 seismic stations, for micro-earthquake monitoring and aftershock studies, as well as a fully equipped computing centre. The main research interests of UPSL are: monitoring of seismicity, seismic hazard studies, seismic scenarios, study of source and crust properties, development and application of passive seismic tomography methods, investigation of site effects, development of new microzonation methods etc. PSLNET and HUSN networks have a strong potential to improve studies of the seismic sources and reveal details of the complicated tectonic regime in Greece. Data collected by PSLNET are available to scientists upon request, station LTK is available to Orfeus. \u000a\u000a\u000aNumber of instruments and type: 27 permanent broad band seismic stations, 120 portables (short period sensors)\u000a"},

description:\u000a\u000aSince 1997 an upgrade of the Seismic Network operated in Greece by the Institute of Geodynamics of the National Observatory of Athens (NOA-IG) from analogue to digital was implemented. This involved upgrade of the seismic network monitoring and automatic processing system by implementing Seedlink - SeisComP freeware software. This made it compatible with the most seismic networks in Europe and gave the possibility to exchange data on line. The 24/7 control room at NOA-IG was upgraded to meet the responsibilities of a modern operational seismicity reporting service. The resulted Hellenic Broadband Network (HL) currently operates with a dedicated web page http://bbnet.gein.noa.gr and gives information on automatic locations for earthquakes that occur in Greece and adjacent region. Data exchange in near real time with Orfeus ODC, GEOFON, MEDNET, IRIS is currently ongoing. Moment tensor solutions are also made available via a semi-automated procedure that operates routinely at NOA-IG. Parametric data are made available via the web-page and an Arclink development will soon make also waveforms available via the same web page. A vast number of publications exist with data used from the HL network. This included strong earthquakes occurred in Greece, tomography studies, attenuation studies etc, as well as a published moment tensor database that was completed recently and is made available.\u000aNumber of instruments and type: 43 permanent broad band seismic stations, 20 portable seismic stations (short period and broad band sensors)\u000aData: Waveforms, Bulletin Parametric Data, Moment Tensors, Catalogues\u000a\u000aType: Time series, seismicity catalogue of Greece, moment tensors\u000aFormat: miniSeed format for time series, catalogue as text file (format IMS1.0)\u000aIf field instrumentation: ADSL, GPRS/3G and Satellite transmission for permanent stations, GPRS/3G for portable stations\u000a"},

The main turn points of the history of this network are theÃƒâ€š beginning of its deployment in 1972Ãƒâ€š by the installation of 15 analogueÃƒâ€š SMA-1Ãƒâ€š type accelerographs - the first ever used in Greece -, the increase of the installed instruments to 40 in 1986 and the gradual use of digital instruments ofÃƒâ€š A-800Ãƒâ€š type since 1995. By the end of 2008 the installed instruments (A800/A900,Ãƒâ€š QDR,Ãƒâ€š ETNAÃƒâ€š andÃƒâ€š CMG-5TD) reached the number of 85 after the financial support of the State or within the frame of scientific projects.Ãƒâ€š \u000aAt that time, Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization supported financially NOAIG and ITSAK for the development of the National Strong Motion Network. Via this project NOAIG purchased more than 80 modern 24-bits accelerographs of CMG-5TD type, doubling in such a way the number of the installed instruments.\u000aÃƒâ€š The majority of the instruments are located in urban complexes, taking into account the population density and the seismicity of the Greek territory.

The Laboratory first operated in 1929. Ever since, its major axes of contribution have been the education of students as well as the monitoring of seismicity of the area of Greece. During the last 80 years NKUA-SL has greatly contributed to the scientific advances in the field of Seismology and Applied Geophysics in Greece. In the course of its activities over the years, a better understanding of the seismicity, seismic hazard and seismic risk of the area of Greece was accomplished. Several local seismic networks were deployed, monitoring the seismicity and determining the seismotectonic regime of certain seismogenic areas. \u000a\u000aNKUA-SL operates a broadband real-time network consisting of 28 permanent stations (ATHENET) in Central Greece. Data are transmitted in real time via 3G/GPRS to the central processing station, situated at the Laboratory building in Athens University and stored and processed both automatically and manually. Phase picks, locations and moment tensor solutions are presented in the LaboratoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s web page (http://www.geophysics.geol.uoa.gr/). Since 2006 NKUA-SL is a member of the Hellenic Unified Seismic Network (HUSN), in the framework of which more than 100 seismic stations are operated, contributing thus to the monitoring of the seismic activity of the Greek area.\u000a\u000aSince 1995 NKUA-SL also operates the RASMON strong motion network presently consisting of 16 accelerographs, installed around the Corinth Gulf. This network is currently being upgraded to support on line data transmission. Furthermore, a downhole array consisting of 5 3-component accelerometers is also operated by NKUA-SL in the area of Aigio (Western Gulf of Corinth).\u000a\u000aIn addition, in order to support seismicity monitoring of aftershock sequences and especially targeted projects, NKUA-SL possesses a portable network of 22 seismographs.\u000a\u000aThe recorded data are available upon request or within the framework of research projects according to the corresponding agreements between the involved partners.\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000aNumber of instruments and type: \u000a28 permanent broad band seismic stations (ATHENET network)\u000a16 permanent accelerographic stations (RASMON network)\u000a1 borehole accelerometer 5 3D sensor array (CORSSA array) \u000a22 portable  seismic stations with short period sensors"},

In volcanic areas the magnetic field is characterized by local changes strongly related to magma dynamics. These variations, induced by modifications of the magnetic properties of volcanic rocks, generate a wide variety of magnetic signals that can also appear a long time before an eruption. The characterization of these signals, which seem to depend on the structural heterogeneity and the dynamics of the plumbing system, of each volcanic edifice, can be a useful instrument both for improving the monitoring of active volcanoes as well as developing a greater understanding of the pre-eruptive mechanisms which produce them. \u000aThe state-of-the-art in magnetic monitoring of active volcanoes is represented by the MagNet system developed by Magnetism Research Group of the INGV- Sezione Catania. This system uses data from an array of continuously recording remote magnetic stations spread over the volcanic area and linked by wireless system and mobile phone to Catania, here they are processed, analyzed and plotted in the web site. Each remote station uses components with low energy consumption and a good cost-to-performance ratio. Magnetic stations are equipped with GSM-90 Overhauser effect magnetometers (0.01 nT sensitivity, 0.2 nT accuracy), and fluxgate magnetometers (0.1 nT resolution) designed and developed by the research team of the INGV- Sezione di Roma 2, whose characteristics of long-term stability proved particularly suitable for continuous measurements in harsh environmental conditions.\u000aTo share the measurements throughout the world at the address http://ufgm.ct.ingv.it:8080 it is possible to examine geomagnetic observations carried out at Mt. Etna and Stromboli. In the website data, consisting of one minute, hourly-mean, daily-mean values from the year 1998 onwards, are available on demand.\u000aThe availability of the data may encourage an interdisciplinary research in active volcanic environments.  An integrated approach based on different geophysical data should prove a more efficient and accurate procedure for inferring magmatic sources and minimizing interpretation ambiguity.  "},

description:\u000a\u000aSeismic network born for continuous monitoring (h24) of Italy and surrounding areas.\u000aIn the last decade its objectives have strongly widened toward geophysical research through an increase of stations from 80 units to about 280 (and more, if we include local or cross border networks). Moreover, the station and instrumentation quality has been improved accordingly, switching from 1-component (vertical) short-period stations to high-dinamic broad band ones.\u000aBeside scientific papers, its seismic data ensure scientific products, such as the Italian Seismic Bulletin (with locations and magnitudes of Italian events down to a completeness threshold of 1.8 in magnitude), Moment tensor determinations of earthquakes as small as 3.5 in magnitude) Shake Maps,  and the Catalog of Regional Centroid Moment Tensor, rapid seismicity maps, etc.\u000aData transmission, processing, archiving and distribution are in real time. Transmission is realized on multiple physical links (satellite and terrestrial) and protocol, in order to ensure the most affordable redundancy. Similarly, acquisition is doubled in Rome and mirrored in a geographically different hub in Grottaminarda (South Italy) and data are archived on high availability media in a SAN (Storage Area Netork).\u000aNumber of instruments and type: \u000aAll stations are equipped with 24-bit digitizers and different 3-component sensors:\u000a220 broad band velocimeters \u000a60 short to medium period velocimetes\u000a100 accelerometers (usually co-located with velocimeter in a 6-component station)\u000aStations are often co-located with CGPS instruments.\u000aData: \u000aContinuous data series representing the 3 components of ground velocity or acceleration, sampled tipically at 100 sps.  \u000aFormat: standard miniseed (Data only SEED Volumes).\u000aIn field instrumentation: sensors, power supply and backup (batteries), digitizer and data logger; trasmission by wire lines, internet, radio-modems, optical fibres, WiFi connection, satellite links with different protocols.\u000a"},

Initially the network consisted of 8 short-period stations centred in and around the South Iceland Seismic Zone, where earthquakes of magnitudes up to M7.2 have repeatedly occurred over the last millennium. Over time the network has grown to 59 short period and broad band stations monitoring seismicity in both of Icelandâ€™s seismic zones as well as around several of Icelandâ€™s many active volcanoes. Strong motion seismometers are implemented at three sites in the network.\u000aThe objective of the system has been to realize: (1) real time monitoring of seismic activity down to M~0 in the seismic and volcanic zones of Iceland and (2) recording of high-quality seismic data from microearthquakes, with a high timing accuracy (1Î¼s from the beginning) to enable study of stress release in the seismic zones, with the future goal of earthquake forecasting. From the onset, the focus has also been on detection of unrest in all of Icelandâ€™s active volcanoes. The designation of IMO in 2010 as a state volcano observatory with respect to ICAO has strengthened the volcano monitoring focus of the network. In recent years increased emphasis has been placed on seismic early warning.\u000aThe timing accuracy of the system has enabled detailed mapping of active faults in the South Iceland Seismic Zone and the TjÃ¶rnes Fracture Zone, through relative locations of microearthquakes. Tracking of magma movements and intrusions in the volcanic zones has also been possible, for example at Upptyppingar in the Northern Volcanic Zone and at active volcanoes in the Eastern Volcanic Zone, such as EyjafjallajÃ¶kull volcano and volcanoes under the VatnajÃ¶kull ice cap.\u000aAdditional broad-band stations (donated by BGS) installed in 2010 and 2011 have lowered the detection level of seismicity at Katla volcano and at several volcanoes in VatnajÃ¶kull. The high seismicity rate (10 to 30 thousand per year) and the density of the network enable body-wave, surface-wave and ambient noise tomography studies. Studies of variations in the stress field are\u000aenabled through analysis of the fault plane solutions, which are calculated for all located events.\u000aIn the coming years, when networking will be realized with the strong motion data from the Earthquake Engineering Research Center (an Icelandic stake holder in EPOS), the early warning capabilities of the system will be strengthened. Progress towards achieving this goal is being made within the on-going NERA project."},

This type of apparatus can measure the evolution of the frictional properties of both granular and solid rock materials at normal stresses up to 20 MPa and slip rates ranging from 1 mm/year to 10 m/s. By covering this range of velocities, the HLVRS apparatus allows the laboratory investigation of poorly understood deformation processes occurring at plate boundaries active faults as creeping movements and seismic slip.\u000aThe apparatus is one of the most up-to-date and efficient high velocity rotary shear apparatus anywhere in the world. It is unique in the UK and only other 3 similar apparatuses are installed in the world; 2 in Italy and 1 in China. \u000aThe types of mechanical data produced by the use of the LHVRS apparatus are of interest and can be directly used by a broad community of scientists investigating fault and earthquake mechanics related topics, as structural geologists, seismologists, geophysicists and experimentalists.","year_of_acquisition":"2012-04-02T22:00:00.000Z","purchase_value":0,"quantity":1,"access_policy":"PLEASE SELECT","instrument_www":"","instrument_contact_person":"","instrument_contact_person_phone":"","instrument_contact_person_email":"","instrument_personnel":"PLEASE SELECT","comments":"cylindrical grinder, core pillar, small lathe"}],"lab_contact_person":"Nicola De Paola","lab_contact_person_phone":"+44 0191 334 2333","lab_contact_person_email":"nicola.de-paola@durham.ac.uk","lab_address":"Durham University, Earth Sciences Department","lab_city":"Durham","lab_gpsLat":54.768139,"lab_gpsLon":-1.5718583,"lab_www":"","data_type":[],"status":"","other_details":""},

It is the central station of a network of 34 telemetric seismological\u000astations, which covers a large part of Greece. The primary target of the\u000aSeismological Station is the continuous, on a 24-hours basis, monitoring, recording\u000aand analysis of the seismic activity in Greece and the surrounding lands, as well as\u000athe dissemination of fast and reliable information on large earthquakes to the\u000aauthorities and the public. The personnel of the Seismological Station consist of\u000afaculty members of the Department of Geophysics of AUTH-GL, specialized\u000ascientists with large experience on earthquakes and management of earthquake\u000adisasters, and graduate students of the Department. The Seismological Station of\u000aAUTH-GL has established and continues to pursue collaborations on a plethora of\u000aseismological subjects with both national and international organizations. The\u000aStation's personnel gather data (from both regional and global earthquakes) from the\u000apermanent network on a daily basis, and forward them to the international\u000aseismological data centers (on average, data from 800 earthquakes per month are\u000asent to the international centers). One of the primary tasks of the Seismological\u000aStation of AUTH-GL is to provide timely and accurate earthquake information after\u000athe occurrence of moderate-to-large magnitude earthquakes (which are usually felt\u000aby local populations). In this frame, the personnel of the Seismological Station inform\u000athe public about the on-going seismic activity. Furthermore, the Seismological Station\u000acontributes to the education and training of the public and especially of young\u000astudents, on earthquake hazard and preparedness issues, through tours and\u000alectures, which are regularly organized.\u000aAUTH-GL operates a broadband real-time network consisting of 34 permanent\u000astations (AUTH-NET). Data are transmitted in real time via ADSL/VPN, public ADSL,\u000aUHF modems, Spread Spectrum links, Leased lines with RS-232 modems, and\u000aprivate VSAT to the central seismological station, where they are stored and\u000aprocessed both automatically and manually. Phase picks, locations and moment\u000atensor solutions are presented in the AUTH Seismological Station web page:\u000ahttp://geophysics.geo.auth.gr/the_seisnet/WEBSITE_2005/station_index_en.html\u000aSince 2006 AUTH-GL is a member of the Hellenic Unified Seismic Network (HUSN),\u000ain the framework of which more than 100 seismic stations are operated, contributing\u000athus to the monitoring of the seismic activity of the Greek area.\u000aComplimentary to the above, and in order to support seismicity monitoring of\u000aaftershock sequences and especially targeted projects, AUTH-GL possesses a\u000aportable network of ~20 seismographs.\u000aThe recorded data are available upon request or within the framework of research\u000aprojects according to the corresponding agreements between the involved partners.\u000aNumber of instruments and type:\u000a34 permanent broad band seismic stations (AUTH-NET network)\u000a20 portable seismic stations with broad-band and short period sensors\u000aData:\u000aType: Time series, Catalogue, phase data and source parameters\u000aFormat: Seed format for time series, Fixed column width ASCII for catalogue, phase\u000adata and source parameters\u000aIf field instrumentation: Data transmission between field stations and data centre is\u000aperformed via 3G/GPRS.\u000a"},

It has been developed in the frame of the I3 European project ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNERIESÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and it is now implemented in the frame of the European project ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSHAREÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â.\u000aAHEAD builds upon local archives, resident at varied European institutions (Fig.1). The archived material is defined as the background data of the current parametric catalogues, with the addition of recent investigation not used by those catalogues, yet; in other words, studies (papers, reports, volumes, etc.; historical primary sources were out of the scope) with or without macroseismic data points, from which earthquake parameters were or can be derived.\u000aData can be accessed through an inventory, critically compiled by the central unit that takes care of compiling the information related to the earthquake studies according to uniform criteria. A software has been designed to allow the compilation of the records and the publication of the full inventory through the Internet. It can be queried by earthquake (Fig. 2) and by study (Fig. 3). A section contains material related to events which have been found as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â by the most recent and qualified studies; this is the case of landslides, storms etc. taken as earthquakes by mistake of previous compilers, or earthquakes which have been duplicated with respect to date and/or place. For macroseismic data points (Fig. 4), usually compiled according to varied approaches, standards have been assessed and the regional data recompiled accordingly.\u000aAHEAD covers Europe and is compiled for the time-window 1000-1900 (from 1900 to 1963 for the large events only, so far). It contains data of about 4200 earthquakes, 200 of them being fakes; 2200 earthquakes have macroseismic data points, the total number of them being about 40000. The compilation of 20th century data would be a major achievement, but it would require more or less the same amount of resources as for the compiled time-window 1000-1900. \u000aAHEAD is useful for the scientific and engineer community, which can find the basic material for compiling or checking the existing parametric earthquake catalogues against the most recent information. It is of interest also for a wider audience for which it can represent an authoritative source of information on the earthquake history."},

The main research activity refers to the study of the ground deformation in Tectonic and Volcanic active areas of Greece using satellite geodesy (GPS) and Satellite Radar Interferometry. \u000a\u000aSeveral local GPS networks have been established in Greece (central Ionian Islands, and also along the islands of the Hellenic Volcanic Arc), which are periodically re-measured. Continuous GPS (CGPS) stations (1 Hz)  have been operating since 2005 in selected sites in the mainland of Greece (Athens-UoA1) and at Riolos (RLSO) in NW Peloponnese. The Real-time data are automatically processed on a daily basis using the Bernese Processing Engine (BPE), and time series of station coordinates are monthly produced. The final results may be  combined with other data, such as Interferometric (conventional, PSInSAR, Stacking InSAR),  geophysical, seismological, geochemical and tectonic, too. \u000a\u000aData from the CGPS stations are also used on a daily basis to calculate the Total Electron Content (TEC) of the Ionosphere. TEC variation maps may be produced on a daily basis to explore the correlation of the Ionospheric anomalies associated with the probable occurrence of large magnitude earthquake(s), contributing thus to earthquake prediction research. \u000a"},
