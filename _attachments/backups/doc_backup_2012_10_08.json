During the 2010 eruption the Icelandic met office (IMO) was operating one C-band Doppler radar located at Keflavik international airport which is some distance from the eruption site. In cooperation with the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), IMO has recently invested in two portable, X-band, dual-polarizations Doppler radars and one fixed C-band Doppler radar.\u000a\u000aThe objectives of these upgrades were to obtain better radar coverage of Iceland and acquire higher resolution data, to improve ash particle resolution and mass ejection estimates. The installation of the fixed C-band radar in eastern Iceland was completed in April 2012. In combination with the existing C-band radar at Keflavik airport, IMO has now extended the continuous coverage to almost all of Iceland. The two portable X-band radars are intended to be rapidly deployable to pre-planned sites near erupting volcanos to provide the best possible data quality. The first portable radar was delivered in June 2012; the second one will be delivered at the beginning of 2013.\u000a\u000aThe permanent radars are located at:\u000alat=64.032  lon=-22.636\u000alat=65.028  lon=-15.038\u000a\u000a"},

In addition, the MEO forms the data and analysis center for the BayernNetz, a network of 27 digital seismic stations designed for monitoring the seismic activity in Bavaria and neighboring areas (http://www.erdbeben-in-bayern.de).\u000aThe MEO is contributing to the OREFEUS based VEBSN with additional\u000abroadband stations RotzenmÃ¼hle (ROTZ, Manzenberg (MANZ), Jochberg\u000a(RJOB), Monatzhausen (BE1)and Garching a.d. Alz (KW1). The MEO is actively involved in the\u000aseismic monitoring of deep geothermal power plants located in the Bavarian molasses. This is part of a Federal Ministry of Environment financed research project on induced seismicity. The focus of the scientific research at the MEO seismology branch consists on the investigation of swarm quake areas and mechanisms (Vogtland; Bad\u000aReichenhall) and research on volcano induced seismic signals as well as in improving monitoring capabilities of seismological/volcanic surveillance networks. This includes also the development of software solutions for seismological/volcanological observatories.\u000aGeomagnetics: It is the Munich Earth Observatory's RESPONSIBILITY to\u000acontinuously measure the Earth's magnetic field at its location in\u000aFuerstenfeldbruck, far away from the busy city of Munich and other industrial areas, where artificial magnetic fields would interfere the measurements. The geological subsurface at Fuerstenfeldbruck makes the location ideal to measure the magnetic main field that originates from the Earth's core.\u000aMeasurements were started in 1939 and are a continuation of the measurements in Maisach (1927 - 1932) and Munich (1840 - 1926). This\u000aallows the Munich Earth Observatory to continue one of the oldest and most precious time series in geomagnetism. Our observatory's MISSION is: (1) to reliably track the changes of the Earth's magnetic field with absolute accuracy and highest temporal resolution by means of the most advanced instruments and techniques available, (2) to conduct research on the observatory's and\u000aothers' geomagnetic field data and to attract external funding for these studies, (3) to make available its expertise in geomagnetic field\u000ameasurements to others in the form of international scientific co-operations,public outreach, and university education."},

It is one of the longest running test sites in the world, aiming to allow detailed and well documented studies in many fields of Engineering Seismology, Earthquake Engineering, Soil Dynamics and Seismology, open to the scientific community. Emphasis is given to the experimental and theoretical analysis of complex site effects, wave propagation and the soil-foundation-structure interaction. EUROSEISTEST is also specially designed and constructed for the validation of various codes in earthquake engineering, wave propagation in complex media, weak and strong ground motion estimates; moreover it is adequate for the development of new technologies and innovative methods to assess the dynamic soil properties and geophysics (i.e. ambient noise measurements). It is a unique large-scale test site, allowing combined geophysical, geotechnical and structural experiments and high level studies. \u000a\u000aThe 2D N-cross section (initially in the N ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ S cross-section), in the middle of the valley was efficiently determined with an extensive program of geophysical and geotechnical surveys (Figures 1 & 2). Based on this well constrained 2D structure, different theoretical and experimental site response analyses have been made (Figure 3). These studies have shown the large impact that surface geology and local site conditions have on ground motion, due to surface waves diffraction at the edges and lateral discontinuities of the basin. The Mygdonian valley, however, is a complex 3D structure, and the selection of a 2D cross-section was a compromise between the need to study a complex valley and the available resources. The recent improvement and upgrade of EUROSEISTEST large-scale facility is now providing the detailed geometry and geotechnical properties of the actual 3D structure (approximately 10x20km, Figure 4). The extension from 2D into a fully 3D structure contributes significantly in understanding the physics of wave propagation in complex geology and in response, as well as to improve the accuracy of prediction for the design strong ground motion. Actually EUROSEISTEST valley is probably the best-known valley in the world, both from the geometrical and the geological-geotechnical point of view.\u000a\u000aThe seismicity of the area is monitored on continuous basis by the seismological network of the Aristotle University and the permanent strong motion EUROSEISTEST array. The array has continuously expanded since 1993, and is presently deployed in a 3D configuration, while it comprises 20 high-resolution surface and down-hole stations, covering the main part of the valley (Figures 5 & 6).\u000a\u000aBesides the permanent strong motion network a simplified model SDOF structure has been designed, constructed and instrumented in the centre of the valley (TST see Figure 5), in order to perform dynamic forced and free response analyses, and investigate the soil-foundation-structure interaction phenomenon (Figure 7). The model structure comprises of a reinforced concrete foundation plate, and four steel columns supporting the reinforced concrete roof, joined together with X-braces in both directions. The whole foundation-structure system has configurable mass (total foundation mass may vary from 20 to 30 tonnes) stiffness depending also on the mass. The fixed base resonant frequency of the model may range from 5 to 10Hz, in order to adjust its dynamic properties according to the need. The outer dimensions of the structure are 3x3x5.2m. A temporary array of high resolution accelerometers, velocimeters, seismometers and strain gages can been deployed on the structures, beneath the structure at different depths and on the surface of the ground around the structure in order to record the wave propagation field (with depth as well), the ground  and structural response due to forced or free vibration tests. Earthquakes (quite frequent in the region) could be also recorded.\u000a\u000aThe simplified structure and its temporary or semi-temporary monitoring system (see Figure 7), along with the permanent strong motion array in EUROSEISTEST, can be used in order to simulate in large physical scale the soil-foundation-structure interaction phenomenon. Using the existing equipment and facilities, forced and free vibration tests can be performed either by pull-out of the structure, or with an eccentric mass shaker. The model structure is also perfectly appropriate to perform system identification analyses, as well as investigation of the wave field and the soil behaviour in the vicinity of the oscillating structure due to the structural vibration. \u000a\u000aA large number of universities and institutes from all over the world have been involved in its activities of EUROSEISTEST and more than 200 scientific papers, based on EUROSEISTEST data and results, have been published in books, journals and peer review proceedings of international conferences.\u000a"},

Since then, one of its main objectives is monitoring of seismicity in Western Greece, the area with the highest seismicity in Europe. UPSL is now member of the recently established Hellenic Unified Seismic Network (HUSN), an association operating more than 100 seismic stations. Within HUSN, UPSL has the responsibility of earthquake monitoring in central-western Greece. This task is accomplished through the operation of PSLNET (Patras Satellite Link NETwork). This is a network based on broad band sensors and digital satellite transmission comprising 27 stations. Real time data are transmitted to central station in Patras University and then stored and processed both automatically and manually. Phase picks, locations and moment tensor solutions are stored in our web page (http://seismo.geology.upatras.gr/) and also sent to EMSC.  UPSL possesses a portable network of 120 seismic stations, for micro-earthquake monitoring and aftershock studies, as well as a fully equipped computing centre. The main research interests of UPSL are: monitoring of seismicity, seismic hazard studies, seismic scenarios, study of source and crust properties, development and application of passive seismic tomography methods, investigation of site effects, development of new microzonation methods etc. PSLNET and HUSN networks have a strong potential to improve studies of the seismic sources and reveal details of the complicated tectonic regime in Greece.

description:\u000a\u000aSince 1997 an upgrade of the Seismic Network operated in Greece by the Institute of Geodynamics of the National Observatory of Athens (NOA-IG) from analogue to digital was implemented. This involved upgrade of the seismic network monitoring and automatic processing system by implementing Seedlink - SeisComP freeware software. This made it compatible with the most seismic networks in Europe and gave the possibility to exchange data on line. The 24/7 control room at NOA-IG was upgraded to meet the responsibilities of a modern operational seismicity reporting service. The resulted Hellenic Broadband Network (HL) currently operates with a dedicated web page http://bbnet.gein.noa.gr and gives information on automatic locations for earthquakes that occur in Greece and adjacent region. Data exchange in near real time with Orfeus ODC, GEOFON, MEDNET, IRIS is currently ongoing. Moment tensor solutions are also made available via a semi-automated procedure that operates routinely at NOA-IG. Parametric data are made available via the web-page and an Arclink development will soon make also waveforms available via the same web page. A vast number of publications exist with data used from the HL network. This included strong earthquakes occurred in Greece, tomography studies, attenuation studies etc, as well as a published moment tensor database that was completed recently and is made available.\u000aNumber of instruments and type: 43 permanent broad band seismic stations, 20 portable seismic stations (short period and broad band sensors)\u000aData: Waveforms, Bulletin Parametric Data, Moment Tensors, Catalogues\u000a\u000aType: Time series, seismicity catalogue of Greece, moment tensors\u000aFormat: miniSeed format for time series, catalogue as text file (format IMS1.0)\u000aIf field instrumentation: ADSL, GPRS/3G and Satellite transmission for permanent stations, GPRS/3G for portable stations\u000a\u000a\u000a \\u000a\\u000aInstitute of Geodynamics, National Observatory of Athens has been operating a permanent strong motion network since 1972. The main turn points of the history of this network are theÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ beginning of its deployment in 1972ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ by the installation of 15 analogueÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ SMA-1ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ type accelerographs - the first ever used in Greece -, the increase of the installed instruments to 40 in 1986 and the gradual use of digital instruments ofÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ A-800ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ type since 1995. By the end of 2008 the installed instruments (A800/A900,ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ QDR,ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ ETNAÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ andÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ CMG-5TD) reached the number of 85 after the financial support of the State or within the frame of scientific projects.ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ \\u000aAt that time, Earthquake Planning and Protection Organization supported financially NOAIG and ITSAK for the development of the National Strong Motion Network. Via this project NOAIG purchased more than 80 modern 24-bits accelerographs of CMG-5TD type, doubling in such a way the number of the installed instruments.\\u000aÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ The majority of the instruments are located in urban complexes, taking into account the population density and the seismicity of the Greek territory. Local strong motion arrays are also developed in some cities. The most important of these is the one covering the broader area of Athens. Limited number of instruments are installed at archaeological (Athens' Acropolis) or historical sites.\\u000aTheÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ telemetric connectionÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡ of the installed instruments, which is in progress during the last years, improves the reliability of the network.\\u000aThe processed records are continuously updating the strong motion database of the Institute and are used in various projects (education, improvement of earthquake resistant code).\\u000ahttp://www.gein.noa.gr/Kalogeras/pdf/03-10.pdf\\u000ahttp://www.gein.noa.gr/Kalogeras/pdf/03-15.pdf\\u000a\\u000aNumber of instruments and type: 120 and increasing ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ã‚Â¬ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ digital accelerographs 11-24bits\\u000a\u000a"},

description:\u000a\u000aSeismic network born for continuous monitoring (h24) of Italy and surrounding areas.\u000aIn the last decade its objectives have strongly widened toward geophysical research through an increase of stations from 80 units to about 280 (and more, if we include local or cross border networks). Moreover, the station and instrumentation quality has been improved accordingly, switching from 1-component (vertical) short-period stations to high-dinamic broad band ones.\u000aBeside scientific papers, its seismic data ensure scientific products, such as the Italian Seismic Bulletin (with locations and magnitudes of Italian events down to a completeness threshold of 1.8 in magnitude), Moment tensor determinations of earthquakes as small as 3.5 in magnitude) Shake Maps,  and the Catalog of Regional Centroid Moment Tensor, rapid seismicity maps, etc.\u000aData transmission, processing, archiving and distribution are in real time. Transmission is realized on multiple physical links (satellite and terrestrial) and protocol, in order to ensure the most affordable redundancy. Similarly, acquisition is doubled in Rome and mirrored in a geographically different hub in Grottaminarda (South Italy) and data are archived on high availability media in a SAN (Storage Area Netork).\u000aNumber of instruments and type: \u000aAll stations are equipped with 24-bit digitizers and different 3-component sensors:\u000a220 broad band velocimeters \u000a60 short to medium period velocimetes\u000a100 accelerometers (usually co-located with velocimeter in a 6-component station)\u000aStations are often co-located with CGPS instruments.\u000aData: \u000aContinuous data series representing the 3 components of ground velocity or acceleration, sampled tipically at 100 sps.  \u000aFormat: standard miniseed (Data only SEED Volumes).\u000aIn field instrumentation: sensors, power supply and backup (batteries), digitizer and data logger; trasmission by wire lines, internet, radio-modems, optical fibres, WiFi connection, satellite links with different protocols.\u000a"},

Initially the network consisted of 8 short-period stations centred in and around the South Iceland Seismic Zone, where earthquakes of magnitudes up to M7.2 have repeatedly occurred over the last millennium. Over time the network has grown to 59 short period and broad band stations monitoring seismicity in both of Icelandâ€™s seismic zones as well as around several of Icelandâ€™s many active volcanoes. Strong motion seismometers are implemented at three sites in the network.\u000aThe objective of the system has been to realize: (1) real time monitoring of seismic activity down to M~0 in the seismic and volcanic zones of Iceland and (2) recording of high-quality seismic data from microearthquakes, with a high timing accuracy (1Î¼s from the beginning) to enable study of stress release in the seismic zones, with the future goal of earthquake forecasting. From the onset, the focus has also been on detection of unrest in all of Icelandâ€™s active volcanoes. The designation of IMO as a state volcano observatory with respect to ICAO has strengthened the volcano monitoring focus of the network. In recent years increased emphasis has been placed on seismic early warning.\u000aThe timing accuracy of the system has enabled detailed mapping of active faults in the South Iceland Seismic Zone and the TjÃ¶rnes Fracture Zone, through relative locations of microearthquakes. Tracking of magma movements and intrusions in the volcanic zones has also been possible, for example at Upptyppingar in the Northern Volcanic Zone and at active volcanoes in the Eastern Volcanic Zone, such as EyjafjallajÃ¶kull volcano and volcanoes under the VatnajÃ¶kull ice cap.\u000aAdditional broad-band stations (donated by BGS) installed in 2010 and 2011 have lowered the detection level of seismicity at Katla volcano and at several volcanoes in VatnajÃ¶kull. The high seismicity rate (10 to 30 thousand per year) and the density of the network enable body-wave, surface-wave and ambient noise tomography studies. Studies of variations in the stress field are\u000aenabled through analysis of the fault plane solutions, which are calculated for all located events.\u000aIn the coming years, when networking will be realized with the strong motion data from the Earthquake Engineering Research Center (an Icelandic stake holder in EPOS), the early warning capabilities of the system will be strengthened. Progress towards achieving this goal is being made within the on-going NERA project."},

Forecasting is performed by using automatic procedures for: i) downloading weather forecast data from meteorological mesoscale models; ii) running models of tephra dispersal, iii) plotting hazard maps of volcanic ash dispersal and deposition for certain scenarios and, iv) publishing the results on a web-site dedicated to the Italian Civil Protection. Simulations are based on eruptive scenarios obtained by field data collected from recent Etna eruptions. Forecasting is, hence, supported by plume observations carried out by the monitoring system. The system is successfully operative since 2009. People working in decision-making may really take the advantage of results of this system. "},

The proposed system consists of a platform that implements a relational database model, using the MySQL infrastructure. Due to its complexity, the technical group within the 3.5 TTC (which involve also the INGV Sections in Pisa, Naples, RomeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦) has created different tasks to get the following results: i) establishment of an initial structured repository for the consolidation of the information. ii) design and implementation of the database platform, the definition of user policies, accounting and security policies, iii) establishment of a standardized procedure for automatic data collection."},

Mediterrean Network (MedNet) is a network of very broadband seismic stations installed in the Countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea and mantained by INGV in cooperation with many geophysical institutes.\u000aSince its initial plan (1988), MedNet was meant to give a contribution to the instrumental coverage of the Mediterranean area with state-of-the-art seismographic equipment. This is indeed a region of high seismicity and a complex tectonic environment. Its interest for earth sciences, and seismology in particular, is high, but high quality, broadband instrumentation is not sufficiently diffused. MEDNET represents an effort to improve this situation.\u000aData transmission, processing, archiving and distribution are in real time. Transmission is realized on multiple physical links (satellite and terrestrial) and protocol, in order to ensure the most affordable redundancy. Data are archived on high availability media in a SAN (Storage Area Netork) and represent an important contribution in the Euro-Med region modern seismology.\u000aNumber of instruments and type: \u000aAll 25 stations are equipped with 24-bit digitizers and very broad band 3-component sensors, with frequency band from 0.01 (in a few cases 0.003) to 100 Hz. Station in Italy are also equipped with accelerometers.\u000a\u000aData: \u000aContinuous data series representing the 3 components of ground velocity or acceleration, sampled tipically at 100 sps.  \u000aFormat: standard miniseed (Data only SEED Volumes).\u000aIn field instrumentation: sensors, power supply and backup (batteries), digitizer and data logger; gps timing;  trasmission by wire lines, internet, satellite links with different protocols.\u000a"},

description:\u000a\u000aThe Seismological Station of AUTH-GL was founded in 1978 and belongs to the\u000aDepartment of Geophysics of the School of Geology of the Aristotle University of\u000aThessaloniki. It is the central station of a network of 34 telemetric seismological\u000astations, which covers a large part of Greece. The primary target of the\u000aSeismological Station is the continuous, on a 24-hours basis, monitoring, recording\u000aand analysis of the seismic activity in Greece and the surrounding lands, as well as\u000athe dissemination of fast and reliable information on large earthquakes to the\u000aauthorities and the public. The personnel of the Seismological Station consist of\u000afaculty members of the Department of Geophysics of AUTH-GL, specialized\u000ascientists with large experience on earthquakes and management of earthquake\u000adisasters, and graduate students of the Department. The Seismological Station of\u000aAUTH-GL has established and continues to pursue collaborations on a plethora of\u000aseismological subjects with both national and international organizations. The\u000aStation's personnel gather data (from both regional and global earthquakes) from the\u000apermanent network on a daily basis, and forward them to the international\u000aseismological data centers (on average, data from 800 earthquakes per month are\u000asent to the international centers). One of the primary tasks of the Seismological\u000aStation of AUTH-GL is to provide timely and accurate earthquake information after\u000athe occurrence of moderate-to-large magnitude earthquakes (which are usually felt\u000aby local populations). In this frame, the personnel of the Seismological Station inform\u000athe public about the on-going seismic activity. Furthermore, the Seismological Station\u000acontributes to the education and training of the public and especially of young\u000astudents, on earthquake hazard and preparedness issues, through tours and\u000alectures, which are regularly organized.\u000aAUTH-GL operates a broadband real-time network consisting of 34 permanent\u000astations (AUTH-NET). Data are transmitted in real time via ADSL/VPN, public ADSL,\u000aUHF modems, Spread Spectrum links, Leased lines with RS-232 modems, and\u000aprivate VSAT to the central seismological station, where they are stored and\u000aprocessed both automatically and manually. Phase picks, locations and moment\u000atensor solutions are presented in the AUTH Seismological Station web page:\u000ahttp://geophysics.geo.auth.gr/the_seisnet/WEBSITE_2005/station_index_en.html\u000aSince 2006 AUTH-GL is a member of the Hellenic Unified Seismic Network (HUSN),\u000ain the framework of which more than 100 seismic stations are operated, contributing\u000athus to the monitoring of the seismic activity of the Greek area.\u000aComplimentary to the above, and in order to support seismicity monitoring of\u000aaftershock sequences and especially targeted projects, AUTH-GL possesses a\u000aportable network of ~20 seismographs.\u000aThe recorded data are available upon request or within the framework of research\u000aprojects according to the corresponding agreements between the involved partners.\u000aNumber of instruments and type:\u000a34 permanent broad band seismic stations (AUTH-NET network)\u000a20 portable seismic stations with broad-band and short period sensors\u000aData:\u000aType: Time series, Catalogue, phase data and source parameters\u000aFormat: Seed format for time series, Fixed column width ASCII for catalogue, phase\u000adata and source parameters\u000aIf field instrumentation: Data transmission between field stations and data centre is\u000aperformed via 3G/GPRS.\u000a"},

It has been developed in the frame of the I3 European project ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œNERIESÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â and it is now implemented in the frame of the European project ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSHAREÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â.\u000aAHEAD builds upon local archives, resident at varied European institutions (Fig.1). The archived material is defined as the background data of the current parametric catalogues, with the addition of recent investigation not used by those catalogues, yet; in other words, studies (papers, reports, volumes, etc.; historical primary sources were out of the scope) with or without macroseismic data points, from which earthquake parameters were or can be derived.\u000aData can be accessed through an inventory, critically compiled by the central unit that takes care of compiling the information related to the earthquake studies according to uniform criteria. A software has been designed to allow the compilation of the records and the publication of the full inventory through the Internet. It can be queried by earthquake (Fig. 2) and by study (Fig. 3). A section contains material related to events which have been found as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œfakeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â by the most recent and qualified studies; this is the case of landslides, storms etc. taken as earthquakes by mistake of previous compilers, or earthquakes which have been duplicated with respect to date and/or place. For macroseismic data points (Fig. 4), usually compiled according to varied approaches, standards have been assessed and the regional data recompiled accordingly.\u000aAHEAD covers Europe and is compiled for the time-window 1000-1900 (from 1900 to 1963 for the large events only, so far). It contains data of about 4200 earthquakes, 200 of them being fakes; 2200 earthquakes have macroseismic data points, the total number of them being about 40000. The compilation of 20th century data would be a major achievement, but it would require more or less the same amount of resources as for the compiled time-window 1000-1900. \u000aAHEAD is useful for the scientific and engineer community, which can find the basic material for compiling or checking the existing parametric earthquake catalogues against the most recent information. It is of interest also for a wider audience for which it can represent an authoritative source of information on the earthquake history."},

IMO is responsible for the operation of the network, with operational support provided by CIW. The strainmeter network was initially intended to record crustal deformation caused by strong earthquakes in SISZ, but it has proved essential for monitoring volcanic eruptions of Hekla. The station BUR is positioned ~14.3 km north-west from the volcano's summit.\u000a\u000aWhen originally installed, the Iceland network comprised seven stations - three of which are operational today. The strain meters were grouted into boreholes in and around the SISZ. A new strainmeter was installed in September 2010, in a purpose-drilled borehole ~5 km south-east of the summit of Hekla; it is estimated that this station (HEK) is at least five times more sensitive to magma movements than BUR. Alongside the installation of HEK, a network-wide upgrade of strain acquisition and telemetry hardware took place between 2010 and 2011. Further expansion of the strain network is planned in coming years. \u000a"},

The main research activity refers to the study of the ground deformation in Tectonic and Volcanic active areas of Greece using satellite geodesy (GPS) and Satellite Radar Interferometry. \u000a\u000aSeveral local GPS networks have been established in Greece (central Ionian Islands, and also along the islands of the Hellenic Volcanic Arc), which are periodically re-measured. Continuous GPS (CGPS) stations (1 Hz)  have been operating since 2005 in selected sites in the mainland of Greece (Athens-UoA1) and at Riolos (RLSO) in NW Peloponnese. The Real-time data are automatically processed on a daily basis using the Bernese Processing Engine (BPE), and time series of station coordinates are monthly produced. The final results may be  combined with other data, such as Interferometric (conventional, PSInSAR, Stacking InSAR),  geophysical, seismological, geochemical and tectonic, too. \u000a\u000aData from the CGPS stations are also used on a daily basis to calculate the Total Electron Content (TEC) of the Ionosphere.

Almost all of these stations transmit data at 1Hz sampling rate and these data are also processed in real time and low latency (1 sec). The objectives of these network are two: i) to know day-by-day - or, for some volcanoes, second-by-second - the evolution of the ground deformation pattern for monitoring purposes and ii) to improve our knowledge of the internal processes of magma transfer form depth, focusing in particular those leading to potentially dangerous eruptions. \u000a"},

The Italian Ministry for the Environment originally funded the project to encompass the digitization of seismogram records of the Italian seismic observatories and of associated bulletins for the period 1895â€“1984 (i.e., from the early age of seismometry to the advent of the digital era).\u000aIn 2002, the SISMOS activity was extended to seismograms and bulletins from observatories in 29 countries of the Euro-Mediterranean area through the the EuroSeismos project started in the framework of the activity of the European Seismological Commission Working Group on the History and Data of Instrumental Seismology,. The participating partners gather historical records at their observatories and send them to SISMOS for scanning, archiving, and dissemination. Since May 2006 SISMOS has been one of the facilities of the European project NERIES (Transnational Access 3). In the frame of NERIES SISMOS has indeed been recognised as the most advanced facility for the processing and analysis of analogue recordings of earthquakes in the period 1894-1985. During the 4 years of the NERIES project, the TA3 SISMOS received 20 applications of 16 countries 2 of them extra Europe. From the beginning of the SISMOS project until November 2010 more than 150,000 seismogram records have been scanned and made available. Similarly, historical seismic bulletins have been scanned and are available in AdobeÂ® PDF on the SISMOS Web site.\u000a\u000aThe current data set on which SISMOS operates consists of about 1000 â€œrelevantâ€ earthquakes. The scanning is carried out at 1016-dpi resolution using 3 Eskoscan 2636 flatbed professional scanners. The flow diagram in Figure below provides a schematic view of the processing carried out by SISMOS for scanning, archiving, and disseminating seismogram records. SISMOS has developed the â€œTeseo2â€ software for the digitalisation and vectorisation of the seismograms (the process by which the tracing recorded in raster format is transformed into a series of segments connected between them such as to be reproduced).SISMOS recently has built a restoration laboratory acts upon the seismograms and the most interesting documents, which are particularly damaged and that risk definitively losing the information they contain. Furthermore SISMOS has realized a Laboratory for the restoration of historical instruments. Each instrument is associated with a digital chart complete with photographic images, drafted according to international catalographic norms. The charts will be gathered into catalogues that SISMOS will insert in its own Web pages dedicated to the virtual museum accessible to a diversified remote user base."},

Since 1995, we have realized 36 stations on Mt. Etna, 5 stations on Stromboli volcano, 7 on Vulcano-Lipari complex and 3 on Pantelleria Island. \u000aAll these stations are linked to the master station of Catania through radio link. Almost all of these stations transmit data at 1Hz sampling rate and these data are also processed in real time and low latency (1 sec). The objectives of these network are two: i) to know day-by-day - or, for some volcanoes, second-by-second - the evolution of the ground deformation pattern for monitoring purposes and ii) to improve our knowledge of the internal processes of magma transfer form depth, focusing in particular those leading to potentially dangerous eruptions. \u000a"},

EERC is located in Selfoss, roughly 60 km from the main campus of the University of Iceland in Reykjavik.  Activities at the Centre can be divided into three main groups: basic research, contractual industrial research and training of students for research and building facilities for engineering education. \u000aResearch at the EERC at the University of Iceland is focused on the multi-disciplinary development of fundamental knowledge about societal earthquake effects. In particular the behaviour of structures in an earthquake prone environment using analytical, numerical and experimental methods. The emphasis is on earthquake engineering, applied mechanics and engineering seismology and the synergy between them. Ongoing research projects deal with: strong-motion monitoring and modelling; probabilistic and computational mechanics focusing on applications in earthquake, ocean and wind engineering; natural hazard and risk assessment; methods for the estimation of structural and non-structural damage in civil engineering structures and lifeline systems; loss and casualty estimation methodologies; planning; risk management.\u000aThe cornerstone of the scientific research activities at the EERC is its Icelandic Strong-motion Network (IceSMN). The Network was initiated in 1984 and is the only network of its kind in Iceland. The earthquake recordings that are provided by the network form the basis of the estimation of earthquake hazard and seismic risk in the country. The objectives of the network are to collect earthquake engineering data required for rational structural design and risk management. The network includes free-field stand-alone stations, a free-field array, and structural monitoring systems. The ICESMN has produced unique strong-motion data, which was non-existent before its establishment, but is now a part of the European Strong-motion Databank freely available via the Internet. The Network is still a unique scientific field laboratory in Iceland. The EERC also owns and operates the ICEARRAY, a new and permanent small-aperture strong-motion array in the South Iceland Seismic Zone.\u000a\u0009The objectives of the Icelandic Strong-motion Network are to collect data required for engineering seismological research as well as earthquake engineering research emphasising rational structural design and risk management. The locations of the stations in the Network were selected on the basis of geophysical information, the geographic distribution of the population, locations of industrial and power plants as well as the main lifeline systems.\u000aThe Icelandic Strong-motion Network consists of 58 stations measuring the ground response and structural response. The network consists of free-field stations, ground responce arrays, and structural monitoring systems. All ground response stations consist of three-component instruments and structural monitoring systems vary in single- vs. three-component configuration. At present, the network comprises a total of 254 components (equivalent to 84 three-component stations) and runs with a high degree of automation, using digital instruments. The stations are connected to a central computer that records detected events when the acceleration exceeds a prescribed threshold. Afterwards the recordings go through a routine processing and are then finally transferred to a database, which is freely accessible (http://www.ISESD.hi.is/). The ISESD was supported by the following European projects: European Strong-Motion Database (5th FP, Contract EVR1-CT-1999-40008) and European Strong-Motion Database Platform (4th FP, Contract ENV4-CT97-0397) (Ambraseys et al., 2004).\u000a"},

All the instruments will be connected to ITSAK through internet facilities and our main target would be the recording and the immediate processing. A newly developed data processing technique is applied for strong motion recordings. In addition to the aforementioned a site characterization of the Greek accelerographic stations is carried out in a joined project among ITSAK, Gi-NOA, Univ.of Patras, UCLA and USGS. Obviously the collaboration/connection of this network with corresponding ones in a European level could significantly contribute in engineering seismology and geotechnical engineering research."},

The monitoring system has since then been expanded to cover most glacial rivers sourced from subglacial volcanoes and geothermal areas. The warning stations monitor water level, water temperature and electrical conductivity of the water. If the water level or the conductivity rises above a predefined value a warning is sent to the Icelandic Meteorological Office where a hydrologist evaluates the warning and, if needed, decides on an action.\u000a\u000aThe objectives of the system are to give early warnings of subglacial floods. It has proven to be useful and has given warnings of on-coming floods. One such warning  was for a flood from the Katla volcano in July 2011, were a bridge was swept away in a fast rising glacial flood (jokulhklaup) in the river Mulakvisl. Because of a warning from one of the stations, the road had been closed before the flood arrived.\u000a\u000aThe network used for volcano monitoring includes 13 hydrological stations.\u000a\u000a"},

Since 1995, we have realized 36 stations on Mt. Etna, 5 stations on Stromboli volcano, 7 on Vulcano-Lipari complex and 3 on Pantelleria Island. \u000aAll these stations are linked to the master station of Catania through radio link. Almost all of these stations transmit data at 1Hz sampling rate and these data are also processed in real time and low latency (1 sec). The objectives of these network are two: i) to know day-by-day - or, for some volcanoes, second-by-second - the evolution of the ground deformation pattern for monitoring purposes and ii) to improve our knowledge of the internal processes of magma transfer form depth, focusing in particular those leading to potentially dangerous eruptions. \u000a"},

Activity at many Icelandic volcanoes (including the most active ones such as Hekla, Katla, and GrÃ­msvÃ¶tn) involves a spectrum of magma compositions (from basaltic through dacitic). An accurate time-series of gas emissions may lead towards more sophisticated models for magma differentiation, movement and eruption style. The instruments are suitable for measurements during effusive and explosive activity (both magmatic and hydromagmatic). \u000a(2) To enhance the capacity of volcano monitoring and research into eruption forecasting and risk management in Iceland. Eruptions can sometimes commence without detectable geophysical warnings. It is possible that measurements of the gas composition at seismically â€œquietâ€ volcanoes such as Hekla may be able to detect earlier signals and hence provide a longer warning period.\u000a"},
