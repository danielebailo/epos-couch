In the resonant column  apparatuses  a cylindrical  soil /rock specimen is subjected to longitudinal or torsion  steady-state harmonic vibrations superimposed  upon  an isotropic static stress. The resonant column specimen is identical in shape, dimensions and sampling to those used in classical triaxial testing. The sample  and vibration device are enclosed into a cell chamber where the confining  conditions are supplied by compressed air, water or mineral oil. The pressure amount is so selected that spherical stresses or sample are equivalent ,to the  depth of the sample, to the stress conditions in the field. It is well established that soil/rock response is nonlinear beyond a certain level of deformation. Laboratory tests performed on Hardin and Drnevich resonant columns consistently show the reduction in dynamic torsion modulus functions(G) and increase in torsion damping functions ( Î¾) with increasing shear strain (Î³) above 10-4 %,i.e. these parameters are function of shear strain, G=G(Î³) and Î¾=Î¾(Î³).

In addition, the MEO forms the data and analysis center for\u000athe BayernNetz, a network of 22 digital seismic stations designed for\u000amonitoring the seismic activity in Bavaria and neighboring areas\u000a(http://www.erdbeben-in-bayern.de).\u000aThe MEO is contributing to the OREFEUS based VEBSN with additional\u000abroadband stations RotzenmÃ¼hle (ROTZ, Manzenberg (MANZ), Jochberg\u000a(RJOB) and Garching a.d. Alz (KW1). The MEO is actively involved in the\u000aseismic monitoring of deep geothermal power plants located in the Bavarian\u000amolasses. This is part of a Federal Ministry of Environment financed research\u000aproject on induced seismicity.\u000aThe focus of the scientific research at the MEO seismology branch consists\u000aon the investigation of swarm quake areas and mechanisms (Vogtland; Bad\u000aReichenhall) and research on volcano induced seismic signals as well as in\u000aimproving monitoring capabilities of seismological/volcanic surveillance\u000anetworks. This includes also the development of software solutions for\u000aseismological/volcanological observatories.\u000aGeomagnetics: It is the Munich Earth Observatory's RESPONSIBILITY to\u000acontinuously measure the Earth's magnetic field at its location in\u000aFuerstenfeldbruck, far away from the busy city of Munich and other industrial\u000aareas, where artificial magnetic fields would interfere the measurements. The\u000ageological subsurface at Fuerstenfeldbruck makes the location ideal to\u000ameasure the magnetic main field that originates from the Earth's core.\u000aMeasurements were started in 1939 and are a continuation of the\u000ameasurements in Maisach (1927 - 1932) and Munich (1840 - 1926). This\u000aallows the Munich Earth Observatory to continue one of the oldest and most\u000aprecious time series in geomagnetism. Our observatory's MISSION is: (1) to\u000areliably track the changes of the Earth's magnetic field with absolute accuracy\u000aand highest temporal resolution by means of the most advanced instruments\u000aand techniques available, (2) to conduct research on the observatory's and\u000aothers' geomagnetic field data and to attract external funding for these\u000astudies, (3) to make available its expertise in geomagnetic field\u000ameasurements to others in the form of international scientific co-operations,\u000apublic outreach, and university education.\u000a"},

In addition to the aforementioned a site characterization of the Greek accelerographic stations is carried out in a joined project among ITSAK, Gi-NOA, Univ.of Patras, UCLA and USGS.

It is one of the longest running test sites in the world, aiming to allow detailed and well documented studies in many fields of Engineering Seismology, Earthquake Engineering, Soil Dynamics and Seismology, open to the scientific community. Emphasis is given to the experimental and theoretical analysis of complex site effects, wave propagation and the soil-foundation-structure interaction. EUROSEISTEST is also specially designed and constructed for the validation of various codes in earthquake engineering, wave propagation in complex media, weak and strong ground motion estimates; moreover it is adequate for the development of new technologies and innovative methods to assess the dynamic soil properties and geophysics (i.e. ambient noise measurements). It is a unique large-scale test site, allowing combined geophysical, geotechnical and structural experiments and high level studies. \u000a\u000aThe 2D N-cross section (initially in the N â€“ S cross-section), in the middle of the valley was efficiently determined with an extensive program of geophysical and geotechnical surveys (Figures 1 & 2). Based on this well constrained 2D structure, different theoretical and experimental site response analyses have been made (Figure 3). These studies have shown the large impact that surface geology and local site conditions have on ground motion, due to surface waves diffraction at the edges and lateral discontinuities of the basin. The Mygdonian valley, however, is a complex 3D structure, and the selection of a 2D cross-section was a compromise between the need to study a complex valley and the available resources. The recent improvement and upgrade of EUROSEISTEST large-scale facility is now providing the detailed geometry and geotechnical properties of the actual 3D structure (approximately 10x20km, Figure 4). The extension from 2D into a fully 3D structure contributes significantly in understanding the physics of wave propagation in complex geology and in response, as well as to improve the accuracy of prediction for the design strong ground motion. Actually EUROSEISTEST valley is probably the best-known valley in the world, both from the geometrical and the geological-geotechnical point of view.\u000a\u000aThe seismicity of the area is monitored on continuous basis by the seismological network of the Aristotle University and the permanent strong motion EUROSEISTEST array. The array has continuously expanded since 1993, and is presently deployed in a 3D configuration, while it comprises 20 high-resolution surface and down-hole stations, covering the main part of the valley (Figures 5 & 6).\u000a\u000aBesides the permanent strong motion network a simplified model SDOF structure has been designed, constructed and instrumented in the centre of the valley (TST see Figure 5), in order to perform dynamic forced and free response analyses, and investigate the soil-foundation-structure interaction phenomenon (Figure 7). The model structure comprises of a reinforced concrete foundation plate, and four steel columns supporting the reinforced concrete roof, joined together with X-braces in both directions. The whole foundation-structure system has configurable mass (total foundation mass may vary from 20 to 30 tonnes) stiffness depending also on the mass. The fixed base resonant frequency of the model may range from 5 to 10Hz, in order to adjust its dynamic properties according to the need. The outer dimensions of the structure are 3x3x5.2m. A temporary array of high resolution accelerometers, velocimeters, seismometers and strain gages can been deployed on the structures, beneath the structure at different depths and on the surface of the ground around the structure in order to record the wave propagation field (with depth as well), the ground  and structural response due to forced or free vibration tests. Earthquakes (quite frequent in the region) could be also recorded.\u000a\u000aThe simplified structure and its temporary or semi-temporary monitoring system (see Figure 7), along with the permanent strong motion array in EUROSEISTEST, can be used in order to simulate in large physical scale the soil-foundation-structure interaction phenomenon. Using the existing equipment and facilities, forced and free vibration tests can be performed either by pull-out of the structure, or with an eccentric mass shaker. The model structure is also perfectly appropriate to perform system identification analyses, as well as investigation of the wave field and the soil behaviour in the vicinity of the oscillating structure due to the structural vibration. \u000a\u000aA large number of universities and institutes from all over the world have been involved in its activities of EUROSEISTEST and more than 200 scientific papers, based on EUROSEISTEST data and results, have been published in books, journals and peer review proceedings of international conferences.\u000a"},
