In the resonant column  apparatuses  a cylindrical  soil /rock specimen is subjected to longitudinal or torsion  steady-state harmonic vibrations superimposed  upon  an isotropic static stress. The resonant column specimen is identical in shape, dimensions and sampling to those used in classical triaxial testing. The sample  and vibration device are enclosed into a cell chamber where the confining  conditions are supplied by compressed air, water or mineral oil. The pressure amount is so selected that spherical stresses or sample are equivalent ,to the  depth of the sample, to the stress conditions in the field. It is well established that soil/rock response is nonlinear beyond a certain level of deformation. Laboratory tests performed on Hardin and Drnevich resonant columns consistently show the reduction in dynamic torsion modulus functions(G) and increase in torsion damping functions ( Î¾) with increasing shear strain (Î³) above 10-4 %,i.e. these parameters are function of shear strain, G=G(Î³) and Î¾=Î¾(Î³). Hardin and Drnevich resonant columns  are laboratory apparatuses to get soil/rock modulus  and damping factors for dynamic/seismic  analyses."}],"lab_contact_person":"Stefan Balan","lab_contact_person_phone":"sbalan@infp.ro","lab_contact_person_email":"","lab_address":"Calugareni Street, 12 077125","lab_city":"Magurele-Bucaresti","lab_gpsLat":44.4133348,"lab_gpsLon":26.1203798,"lab_www":"http://www.infp.ro","data_type":[],"status":"","other_details":""},

In addition, the MEO forms the data and analysis center for\u000athe BayernNetz, a network of 22 digital seismic stations designed for\u000amonitoring the seismic activity in Bavaria and neighboring areas\u000a(http://www.erdbeben-in-bayern.de).\u000aThe MEO is contributing to the OREFEUS based VEBSN with additional\u000abroadband stations RotzenmÃ¼hle (ROTZ, Manzenberg (MANZ), Jochberg\u000a(RJOB) and Garching a.d. Alz (KW1). The MEO is actively involved in the\u000aseismic monitoring of deep geothermal power plants located in the Bavarian\u000amolasses. This is part of a Federal Ministry of Environment financed research\u000aproject on induced seismicity.\u000aThe focus of the scientific research at the MEO seismology branch consists\u000aon the investigation of swarm quake areas and mechanisms (Vogtland; Bad\u000aReichenhall) and research on volcano induced seismic signals as well as in\u000aimproving monitoring capabilities of seismological/volcanic surveillance\u000anetworks. This includes also the development of software solutions for\u000aseismological/volcanological observatories.\u000aGeomagnetics: It is the Munich Earth Observatory's RESPONSIBILITY to\u000acontinuously measure the Earth's magnetic field at its location in\u000aFuerstenfeldbruck, far away from the busy city of Munich and other industrial\u000aareas, where artificial magnetic fields would interfere the measurements. The\u000ageological subsurface at Fuerstenfeldbruck makes the location ideal to\u000ameasure the magnetic main field that originates from the Earth's core.\u000aMeasurements were started in 1939 and are a continuation of the\u000ameasurements in Maisach (1927 - 1932) and Munich (1840 - 1926). This\u000aallows the Munich Earth Observatory to continue one of the oldest and most\u000aprecious time series in geomagnetism. Our observatory's MISSION is: (1) to\u000areliably track the changes of the Earth's magnetic field with absolute accuracy\u000aand highest temporal resolution by means of the most advanced instruments\u000aand techniques available, (2) to conduct research on the observatory's and\u000aothers' geomagnetic field data and to attract external funding for these\u000astudies, (3) to make available its expertise in geomagnetic field\u000ameasurements to others in the form of international scientific co-operations,\u000apublic outreach, and university education.\u000a"},

All the instruments will be connected to ITSAK through internet facilities and our main target would be the recording and the immediate processing. A newly developed data processing technique is applied for strong motion recordings. In addition to the aforementioned a site characterization of the Greek accelerographic stations is carried out in a joined project among ITSAK, Gi-NOA, Univ.of Patras, UCLA and USGS.

It is one of the longest running test sites in the world, aiming to allow detailed and well documented studies in many fields of Engineering Seismology, Earthquake Engineering, Soil Dynamics and Seismology, open to the scientific community. Emphasis is given to the experimental and theoretical analysis of complex site effects, wave propagation and the soil-foundation-structure interaction. EUROSEISTEST is also specially designed and constructed for the validation of various codes in earthquake engineering, wave propagation in complex media, weak and strong ground motion estimates; moreover it is adequate for the development of new technologies and innovative methods to assess the dynamic soil properties and geophysics (i.e. ambient noise measurements). It is a unique large-scale test site, allowing combined geophysical, geotechnical and structural experiments and high level studies. \u000a\u000aThe 2D N-cross section (initially in the N â€“ S cross-section), in the middle of the valley was efficiently determined with an extensive program of geophysical and geotechnical surveys (Figures 1 & 2). Based on this well constrained 2D structure, different theoretical and experimental site response analyses have been made (Figure 3). These studies have shown the large impact that surface geology and local site conditions have on ground motion, due to surface waves diffraction at the edges and lateral discontinuities of the basin. The Mygdonian valley, however, is a complex 3D structure, and the selection of a 2D cross-section was a compromise between the need to study a complex valley and the available resources. The recent improvement and upgrade of EUROSEISTEST large-scale facility is now providing the detailed geometry and geotechnical properties of the actual 3D structure (approximately 10x20km, Figure 4). The extension from 2D into a fully 3D structure contributes significantly in understanding the physics of wave propagation in complex geology and in response, as well as to improve the accuracy of prediction for the design strong ground motion. Actually EUROSEISTEST valley is probably the best-known valley in the world, both from the geometrical and the geological-geotechnical point of view.\u000a\u000aThe seismicity of the area is monitored on continuous basis by the seismological network of the Aristotle University and the permanent strong motion EUROSEISTEST array. The array has continuously expanded since 1993, and is presently deployed in a 3D configuration, while it comprises 20 high-resolution surface and down-hole stations, covering the main part of the valley (Figures 5 & 6).\u000a\u000aBesides the permanent strong motion network a simplified model SDOF structure has been designed, constructed and instrumented in the centre of the valley (TST see Figure 5), in order to perform dynamic forced and free response analyses, and investigate the soil-foundation-structure interaction phenomenon (Figure 7). The model structure comprises of a reinforced concrete foundation plate, and four steel columns supporting the reinforced concrete roof, joined together with X-braces in both directions. The whole foundation-structure system has configurable mass (total foundation mass may vary from 20 to 30 tonnes) stiffness depending also on the mass. The fixed base resonant frequency of the model may range from 5 to 10Hz, in order to adjust its dynamic properties according to the need. The outer dimensions of the structure are 3x3x5.2m. A temporary array of high resolution accelerometers, velocimeters, seismometers and strain gages can been deployed on the structures, beneath the structure at different depths and on the surface of the ground around the structure in order to record the wave propagation field (with depth as well), the ground  and structural response due to forced or free vibration tests. Earthquakes (quite frequent in the region) could be also recorded.\u000a\u000aThe simplified structure and its temporary or semi-temporary monitoring system (see Figure 7), along with the permanent strong motion array in EUROSEISTEST, can be used in order to simulate in large physical scale the soil-foundation-structure interaction phenomenon. Using the existing equipment and facilities, forced and free vibration tests can be performed either by pull-out of the structure, or with an eccentric mass shaker. The model structure is also perfectly appropriate to perform system identification analyses, as well as investigation of the wave field and the soil behaviour in the vicinity of the oscillating structure due to the structural vibration. \u000a\u000aA large number of universities and institutes from all over the world have been involved in its activities of EUROSEISTEST and more than 200 scientific papers, based on EUROSEISTEST data and results, have been published in books, journals and peer review proceedings of international conferences.\u000a"},

Simulations are based on eruptive scenarios obtained by field data collected from recent Etna eruptions. Forecasting is, hence, supported by plume observations carried out by the monitoring system. The system is successfully operative since 2009. People working in decision-making may really take the advantage of results of this system. "},

In volcanic areas the magnetic field is characterized by local changes strongly related to magma dynamics. These variations, induced by modifications of the magnetic properties of volcanic rocks, generate a wide variety of magnetic signals that can also appear a long time before an eruption. The characterization of these signals, which seem to depend on the structural heterogeneity and the dynamics of the plumbing system, of each volcanic edifice, can be a useful instrument both for improving the monitoring of active volcanoes as well as developing a greater understanding of the pre-eruptive mechanisms which produce them. \u000aThe state-of-the-art in magnetic monitoring of active volcanoes is represented by the MagNet system developed by Magnetism Research Group of the INGV- Sezione Catania. This system uses data from an array of continuously recording remote magnetic stations spread over the volcanic area and linked by wireless system and mobile phone to Catania, here they are processed, analyzed and plotted in the web site. Each remote station uses components with low energy consumption and a good cost-to-performance ratio. Magnetic stations are equipped with GSM-90 Overhauser effect magnetometers (0.01 nT sensitivity, 0.2 nT accuracy), and fluxgate magnetometers (0.1 nT resolution) designed and developed by the research team of the INGV- Sezione di Roma 2, whose characteristics of long-term stability proved particularly suitable for continuous measurements in harsh environmental conditions.\u000aTo share the measurements throughout the world at the address http://ufgm.ct.ingv.it:8080 it is possible to examine geomagnetic observations carried out at Mt. Etna and Stromboli. In the website data, consisting of one minute, hourly-mean, daily-mean values from the year 1998 onwards, are available on demand.\u000aThe availability of the data may encourage an interdisciplinary research in active volcanic environments.  An integrated approach based on different geophysical data should prove a more efficient and accurate procedure for inferring magmatic sources and minimizing interpretation ambiguity.  "},

toward geophysical research through an increase of stations from 80 units to about 280 (and more, if we include local or cross border networks). Moreover, the station and instrumentation quality has been improved accordingly, switching from 1-component (vertical) short-period stations to high-dinamic broad band ones.\u000aBeside scientific papers, its seismic data ensure scientific products, such as the Italian Seismic Bulletin (with locations and magnitudes of Italian events down to a completeness threshold of 1.8 in magnitude), Moment tensor determinations of earthquakes as small as 3.5 in magnitude) Shake Maps,  and the Catalog of Regional Centroid Moment Tensor, rapid seismicity maps, etc.\u000aData transmission, processing, archiving and distribution are in real time. Transmission is realized on multiple physical links (satellite and terrestrial) and protocol, in order to ensure the most affordable redundancy. Similarly, acquisition is doubled in Rome and mirrored in a geographically different hub in Grottaminarda (South Italy) and data are archived on high availability media in a SAN (Storage Area Netork).\u000aNumber of instruments and type: \u000aAll stations are equipped with 24-bit digitizers and different 3-component sensors:\u000a220 broad band velocimeters \u000a60 short to medium period velocimetes\u000a100 accelerometers (usually co-located with velocimeter in a 6-component station)\u000aStations are often co-located with CGPS instruments.\u000aData: \u000aContinuous data series representing the 3 components of ground velocity or acceleration, sampled tipically at 100 sps.  \u000aFormat: standard miniseed (Data only SEED Volumes).\u000aIn field instrumentation: sensors, power supply and backup (batteries), digitizer and data logger; trasmission by wire lines, internet, radio-modems, optical fibres, WiFi connection, satellite links with different protocols.\u000a"},

WEBNET consists of 13 stations operated jointly by IG-ASCR Prague and IRSM-ASCR Prague: NKC, KVC, VAC, SKC, LBC, POC, KRC, STC, KCC, ZHC, KOC, LAC and TRC. Stations are equipped with passive short-period seismometers SM-3. Broadband seismometers GÃ¼ralp 40-T are operated at stations KKC, ZHC and LAC. Station NKC is also equipped with STS-2 and EpiSensor. All the stations are gradually completed by the GÃ¼ralp 40-T sensors.\u000aWEBNET is formed by two subnets (N and L), which differ in data acquisition systems and telemetry used. Subnet N (stations NKC, SKC, VAC, LBC, POC, STC, KVC, KRC, ZHC and KAC) is equipped with the Janus-Trident (Nanometrics) data acquisition system and with WaveLan microwave telemetry enabling internet access to each station. Subnet L consists of four stations (NKC, KVC, KOC, LAC) equipped with the Lennartz 5800 PCM data acquisition system with one-way radio telemetry. All the WEBNET seismograms are proportional to the ground velocity in a frequency band of 0.5 â€‘ 80 Hz (subnet N) or 0.5 - 60 Hz (subnet L), and 0.033 â€‘ 80 Hz at stations equipped with GÃ¼ralp 40-T seismometers. The sampling rate of all stations is 250 Hz. Subnet N provides both continuous and triggered data while subnet L provides triggered data only. The configuration and the parameter of WEBNET guarantee recording of the West Bohemia/Vogtland events of magnitudes â€‘0.5Â ï‚£Â MLÂ Â ï‚£ 5.\u000aDigital data are transferred in real time to Data center at IG-ASCR in Prague. Nanometrics NAQS server is used for data acquisition. Home-made program SeisBase is used for data processing and archiving. Data are available on request."},

Initially the network\u000aconsisted of 8 short-period stations centred in and around the South Iceland\u000aSeismic Zone, where earthquakes of magnitudes up to M7.2 have repeatedly\u000aoccurred over the last millennium. Over time the network has grown to 59\u000ashort period and broad band stations (Figure 1) monitoring seismicity in both\u000aof Icelandâ€™s seismic zones as well as around several of Icelandâ€™s many active\u000avolcanoes (Figure 2). Strong motion seismometers are implemented at three\u000asites in the network.\u000aThe objective of the system has been to realize: (1) real time monitoring of\u000aseismic activity down to M~0 in the seismic and volcanic zones of Iceland and\u000a(2) recording of high-quality seismic data from microearthquakes, with a high\u000atiming accuracy (1Î¼s from the beginning) to enable study of stress release in\u000athe seismic zones, with the future goal of earthquake forecasting. From the\u000aonset, the focus has also been on detection of unrest in all of Icelandâ€™s active\u000avolcanoes. The designation of IMO in 2010 as a state volcano observatory\u000awith respect to ICAO has strengthened the volcano monitoring focus of the\u000anetwork. In recent years increased emphasis has been placed on seismic\u000aearly warning.\u000aThe timing accuracy of the system has enabled detailed mapping of active\u000afaults in the South Iceland Seismic Zone and the TjÃ¶rnes Fracture Zone,\u000athrough relative locations of microearthquakes. Tracking of magma\u000amovements and intrusions in the volcanic zones has also been possible, for\u000aexample at Upptyppingar in the Northern Volcanic Zone and at active\u000avolcanoes in the Eastern Volcanic Zone, such as EyjafjallajÃ¶kull volcano and\u000avolcanoes under the VatnajÃ¶kull ice cap.\u000aAdditional broad-band stations (donated by BGS) installed in 2010 and 2011\u000ahave lowered the detection level of seismicity at Katla volcano and at several\u000avolcanoes in VatnajÃ¶kull. The high seismicity rate (10 to 30 thousand per\u000ayear) and the density of the network enable body-wave, surface-wave and\u000aambient noise tomography studies. Studies of variations in the stress field are\u000aenabled through analysis of the fault plane solutions, which are calculated for\u000aall located events.\u000aIn the coming years, when networking will be realized with the strong motion\u000adata from the Earthquake Engineering Research Center (an Icelandic stake\u000aholder in EPOS), the early warning capabilities of the system will be\u000astrengthened.

It is the central station of a network of 34 telemetric seismological\u000astations, which covers a large part of Greece. The primary target of the\u000aSeismological Station is the continuous, on a 24-hours basis, monitoring, recording\u000aand analysis of the seismic activity in Greece and the surrounding lands, as well as\u000athe dissemination of fast and reliable information on large earthquakes to the\u000aauthorities and the public. The personnel of the Seismological Station consist of\u000afaculty members of the Department of Geophysics of AUTH-GL, specialized\u000ascientists with large experience on earthquakes and management of earthquake\u000adisasters, and graduate students of the Department. The Seismological Station of\u000aAUTH-GL has established and continues to pursue collaborations on a plethora of\u000aseismological subjects with both national and international organizations. The\u000aStation's personnel gather data (from both regional and global earthquakes) from the\u000apermanent network on a daily basis, and forward them to the international\u000aseismological data centers (on average, data from 800 earthquakes per month are\u000asent to the international centers). One of the primary tasks of the Seismological\u000aStation of AUTH-GL is to provide timely and accurate earthquake information after\u000athe occurrence of moderate-to-large magnitude earthquakes (which are usually felt\u000aby local populations). In this frame, the personnel of the Seismological Station inform\u000athe public about the on-going seismic activity. Furthermore, the Seismological Station\u000acontributes to the education and training of the public and especially of young\u000astudents, on earthquake hazard and preparedness issues, through tours and\u000alectures, which are regularly organized.\u000aAUTH-GL operates a broadband real-time network consisting of 34 permanent\u000astations (AUTH-NET). Data are transmitted in real time via ADSL/VPN, public ADSL,\u000aUHF modems, Spread Spectrum links, Leased lines with RS-232 modems, and\u000aprivate VSAT to the central seismological station, where they are stored and\u000aprocessed both automatically and manually. Phase picks, locations and moment\u000atensor solutions are presented in the AUTH Seismological Station web page:\u000ahttp://geophysics.geo.auth.gr/the_seisnet/WEBSITE_2005/station_index_en.html\u000aSince 2006 AUTH-GL is a member of the Hellenic Unified Seismic Network (HUSN),\u000ain the framework of which more than 100 seismic stations are operated, contributing\u000athus to the monitoring of the seismic activity of the Greek area.\u000aComplimentary to the above, and in order to support seismicity monitoring of\u000aaftershock sequences and especially targeted projects, AUTH-GL possesses a\u000aportable network of ~20 seismographs.\u000aThe recorded data are available upon request or within the framework of research\u000aprojects according to the corresponding agreements between the involved partners.\u000aNumber of instruments and type:\u000a34 permanent broad band seismic stations (AUTH-NET network)\u000a20 portable seismic stations with broad-band and short period sensors\u000aData:\u000aType: Time series, Catalogue, phase data and source parameters\u000aFormat: Seed format for time series, Fixed column width ASCII for catalogue, phase\u000adata and source parameters\u000aIf field instrumentation: Data transmission between field stations and data centre is\u000aperformed via 3G/GPRS.\u000a"},

The main research activity refers to the study of the ground deformation in Tectonic and Volcanic active areas of Greece using satellite geodesy (GPS) and Satellite Radar Interferometry. \u000a\u000aSeveral local GPS networks have been established in Greece (central Ionian Islands, and also along the islands of the Hellenic Volcanic Arc), which are periodically re-measured. Continuous GPS (CGPS) stations (1 Hz)  have been operating since 2005 in selected sites in the mainland of Greece (Athens-UoA1) and at Riolos (RLSO) in NW Peloponnese. The Real-time data are automatically processed on a daily basis using the Bernese Processing Engine (BPE), and time series of station coordinates are monthly produced. The final results may be  combined with other data, such as Interferometric (conventional, PSInSAR, Stacking InSAR),  geophysical, seismological, geochemical and tectonic, too. \u000a\u000aData from the CGPS stations are also used on a daily basis to calculate the Total Electron Content (TEC) of the Ionosphere. TEC variation maps may be produced on a daily basis to explore the correlation of the Ionospheric anomalies associated with the probable occurrence of large magnitude earthquake(s), contributing thus to earthquake prediction research. \u000a","GNSS_stations":[]},
